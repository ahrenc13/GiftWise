# Pricing & Conversion Strategy

## Current Pricing Model

**Free Tier:**
- 1 recommendation per month
- Access to basic features
- Perfect for trying the product

**Basic ($9/month):**
- 5 recommendations per month
- All social integrations
- Premium product catalog
- Custom experience packages

**Pro ($19/month):**
- Unlimited recommendations
- Priority support
- Early access to features
- Luxury experience packages

---

## My Strategic Recommendations

### Problem with Current Pricing:

1. **$9 is too low for value delivered** - You're scraping 6+ platforms, running Claude AI, and providing deep intelligence. That's $20+ worth of value.

2. **Free tier is too generous** - 1 full recommendation/month means power users can just wait and use it free forever.

3. **Missing the valentine's urgency** - Need time-based pricing for seasonal boost.

## Recommended New Pricing Structure

### Free Tier (Lead Generation)
- **NO full recommendations**
- Preview mode only: See 3 sample gift ideas (blurred images, partial descriptions)
- "Unlock full recommendations" CTA
- Connect social accounts (builds investment)
- **Goal:** Get them hooked on the quality, force upgrade to see full results

### Valentine's Special ($14 one-time - Limited Time)
- **3 full recommendations** (perfect for Valentine's + birthday + anniversary)
- All social integrations
- Expires March 1st
- **Urgency:** "Valentine's Special - Save 53% vs monthly"
- **Goal:** Convert fence-sitters with time pressure + one-time pricing psychology

### Monthly Basic ($19/month)
- **5 recommendations per month**
- All features
- Cancel anytime
- **Goal:** Regular gift-givers (parents, thoughtful partners)

### Annual Pro ($149/year = $12.40/month)
- **Unlimited recommendations**
- Save $79 vs monthly
- Priority support
- Early access
- **Goal:** Power users, subscription box consideration

## Viral Growth Mechanics (CRITICAL)

### Referral Rewards:
**Current:** $5 credit per referral
**Recommended:** Make it more compelling

**For Referrer:**
- 3 referrals = 1 free recommendation
- 5 referrals = upgrade to Premium for 1 month
- 10 referrals = Free annual subscription
- Display progress bar: "2 more friends = free Premium!"

**For Referred Friend:**
- Get 1 free recommendation (not just preview)
- "Your friend [Name] sent you a gift - try GiftWise free!"
- Creates obligation + demonstrates value immediately

### Shareable Wishlists:
**Implemented:** Public share links for recommendations
**Add:** 
- "Vote on these gifts!" - Friends can heart their favorites
- Share to specific platforms (Instagram Stories, Twitter, WhatsApp)
- Embed widget for blogs/websites
- Track which gifts get most votes → social proof

### Gamification Tiers:
- Bronze (0-4 referrals): Standard user
- Silver (5-9 referrals): Badge + 20% off annual
- Gold (10-19 referrals): Badge + 1 month free
- Platinum (20+ referrals): Free annual subscription + early features

## Conversion Optimization

### Landing Page Changes:

1. **Social Proof Above Fold**
   - "2,847 thoughtful gifts found this week"
   - "Sarah got her boyfriend the perfect gift in 60 seconds"
   - Real testimonials with photos

2. **Demo Before Signup**
   - Show sample recommendation for "outdoorsy 28-year-old in Denver"
   - Let them see quality before committing

3. **Urgency Messaging**
   - "Valentine's Day is in X days"
   - "429 people found gifts today"
   - Limited time Valentine's pricing

### Onboarding Flow:

**Current:** Sign up → Connect platforms → Generate
**Recommended:** 
1. Enter recipient info (no signup yet)
2. Connect 1 social platform
3. Show "preview" of recommendations (blurred)
4. **Paywall:** "Create free account to see full recommendations"
5. After signup → Full reveal + "Invite 3 friends for another free one!"

This builds investment BEFORE asking for signup, dramatically increasing conversion.

### Email Nurture:

**Day 0:** Welcome + "Your first recommendation is processing"
**Day 1:** "Your recommendations are ready! [CTA]"
**Day 3:** "How'd it go? Get 3 more recommendations free [referral link]"
**Day 7:** "Valentine's Day gift guide - 5 last-minute ideas"
**Day 14:** "Upgrade to unlimited for $X" (missed opportunities angle)

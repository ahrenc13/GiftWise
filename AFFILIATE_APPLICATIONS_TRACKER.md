## CJ Affiliate — Additional Approved Brands (Beyond Initial Batch)

### Macorner ✅ Approved, through CJ (not direct)
- **Network:** CJ Affiliate (ADV_CID: 7110677, our PID: 101660899 already embedded in links)
- **Category:** Personalized/custom gifts — photo pillows, custom mugs, engraved keychains, ornaments
- **Commission:** 10% (non-coupon) — links are ready to use now
- **Available links:** Category-level only (no product feed, no individual SKUs)
  - Personalized Photo Gifts → `https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-101660899-15834514` (EPC: $40.25)
  - Gifts for Him → `https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-101660899-15834498` (EPC: **$132.28** — highest performer)
  - Gifts for Her → `https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-101660899-15834503`
  - Anniversary Gifts → `https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101660899-15834491` (EPC: $34.28)
  - General/Homepage → `https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-101660899-15834488` (EPC: $13.99)

**Integration decision: LOW PRIORITY — do NOT add to main recommendation pipeline**

Macorner sells photo pillows, custom mugs, engraved keychains — the "polite smile" tier of personalized gifts. These are what people buy when they have no idea what to get someone. The engine must NOT surface these by default.

The only valid use case: a profile that explicitly signals sentimental/memory-keeping interest (scrapbooking, new parent, someone who lost a loved one, etc.). Even then, the curator prompt should surface it — not a hardcoded rule.

**Potential future use:** a dedicated "Personalized Gifts" editorial guide (not yet built) where the category expectation is set upfront and the $132 EPC on "Gifts for Him" could perform. Not a current priority.

ShareASale merged with Awin. All ShareASale merchants are now accessible through Awin's platform. The Awin account we already have gives access to these merchants - we just need to search for and join them individually.

**What this means:**
- ✅ No need to apply to ShareASale separately
- ✅ Awin account already approved
- 🔍 Need to search Awin's advertiser directory for former ShareASale brands
- 📝 Join each advertiser individually (like we do with other networks)

**Priority merchants to search for on Awin:**
- Uncommon Goods (unique gifts)
- Personalization Mall (custom items)
- Things Remembered (personalized jewelry)
- Oriental Trading (party/bulk gifts)
- HomeWetBar (custom barware)
- Portland Leather (already found)

        <h1>About Giftwise</h1>
        <p>Helping people find thoughtful gifts since 2026. Expert curation meets AI-powered personalization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Gift giving shouldn't be stressful. Whether you're shopping for your mom, your best friend, or your coworker's baby shower, we believe everyone deserves to give gifts that feel personal and thoughtful — without the hours of research and second-guessing.</p>

        <p>Giftwise combines expert editorial content with AI-powered personalization to solve the hardest part of gift giving: figuring out what someone actually wants.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>

        <h3>Expert-Curated Gift Guides</h3>
        <p>Our editorial team researches, tests, and curates gift guides for every occasion and personality type. From <a href="/guides/mothers-day">Mother's Day</a> to <a href="/guides/dog-parent">gifts for dog parents</a>, we only recommend products we genuinely believe make great gifts.</p>

        <h3>Thoughtful Editorial Content</h3>
        <p>Our <a href="/blog">blog</a> provides practical advice on gift giving etiquette, shopping strategies, and navigating tough gifting scenarios. We write for real people facing real gift-giving challenges — not SEO robots.</p>

        <h3>AI-Powered Personalization (Beta)</h3>
        <p>For users who want personalized recommendations, our AI analyzes social media profiles to understand someone's interests, hobbies, and style — then suggests gifts matched to what they're actually into. It's like having a shopping assistant who knows the recipient personally.</p>

        <div class="principles-box">
            <h3>Our Editorial Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We only recommend what we'd actually give.</strong> Every product in our guides is something we'd genuinely gift to someone we care about.</li>
                <li><strong>We prioritize quality over quantity.</strong> A curated list of 12 great options beats a list of 100 mediocre ones.</li>
                <li><strong>We're transparent about affiliate relationships.</strong> When you click a product link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission. This helps us keep Giftwise free and ad-free. It never influences what we recommend.</li>
                <li><strong>We test when possible.</strong> Our team personally tests products whenever feasible, and we rely on trusted reviews and expert opinions when hands-on testing isn't practical.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p><strong>Giftwise is independently owned and operated</strong> by Chad Ahrendsen, a technologist and gift-giving enthusiast who got tired of spending hours researching gifts only to settle for something generic.</p>

        <p>After years of watching friends and family struggle with the same problem — "What do I get someone who has everything?" or "I have no idea what they're into" — Chad built Giftwise to solve the problem once and for all.</p>

        <div class="team-section">
            <h3>Our Editorial Contributors</h3>
            <p>Giftwise works with a network of freelance writers, product testers, and gift-giving experts who contribute to our guides and blog content. Our contributors have backgrounds in lifestyle journalism, e-commerce, and consumer product research.</p>

            <p>Every piece of content is reviewed for accuracy, quality, and alignment with our editorial principles before publication.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How We Make Money</h2>

        <div class="disclosure">
            <strong>Affiliate Disclosure</strong><br>
            Giftwise participates in affiliate marketing programs. When you click a product link in our gift guides or blog posts and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps us cover the cost of running Giftwise and allows us to keep our content free for everyone.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Our affiliate relationships never influence what we recommend.</strong> We choose products based on quality, relevance, and thoughtfulness — not commission rates. If a product isn't worth recommending, it doesn't make it into our guides, regardless of the affiliate program.
        </div>

        <p>We partner with trusted affiliate networks and retailers including Amazon Associates, Awin (Etsy, UGG, Lululemon), eBay Partner Network, and others. We disclose affiliate links clearly on every page where they appear.</p>

        <p>In the future, we may offer premium features (like unlimited AI-powered recommendations) through an optional subscription, but all editorial content will always remain free.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>No spam, ever.</strong> We won't sell your email or bombard you with promotional messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy first.</strong> We don't track you across the web or sell your data. See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</li>
            <li><strong>Honest recommendations.</strong> We don't feature products just because they pay higher commissions. Our recommendations are based on quality, not kickbacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous improvement.</strong> We update our gift guides regularly to reflect new products, seasonal availability, and user feedback.</li>
        </ul>

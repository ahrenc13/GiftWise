## Skimlinks Strategy

**What it is:** Aggregator across 50+ affiliate networks. 48,500+ merchants. One integration, one contract.

**How it works:**
- Product Key API v2: `https://products.skimapis.com/v2/publisher/{pub_id}/product`
- Auth: `https://authentication.skimapis.com/access_token` (OAuth client credentials)
- Link wrapper: `https://go.skimresources.com/?id={pub_id}&url={encoded_merchant_url}`
- No per-merchant joining — all merchants available immediately on acceptance

**Trade-off:** 25% revenue share (you keep 75% of earned commissions)

**Acceptance rate:** ~3%. They review for:
- Editorial quality (not just coupon/deal spam)
- Real content with outbound merchant links
- Affiliate disclosures
- Privacy policy and terms

**Our readiness:** 6 editorial gift guides deployed, affiliate disclosures in footer, `/privacy` and `/terms` routes live. Code complete in `skimlinks_searcher.py`.

# 📝 GiftWise Project Notes
**Key Decisions & Context**

## Core Product Focus (Jan 2026)

**Priority:** Make recommendations EXCELLENT, not build retention features yet.

**Key Principles:**
1. Mine ALL data possible from connected platforms
2. Use data intelligently (engagement weighting, aspirational vs current)
3. Retailer diversity: Not just Amazon - Etsy, independent makers, but accessible (no 6-month shipping)
4. Perfect gift might be on Amazon - that's fine, but also scour for unique finds
5. Avoid user paralysis - present options clearly, don't overwhelm

## Data Sources Strategy

**Current:** Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, Spotify

**Adding:**
- Etsy wishlist (high priority)
- Goodreads (book lovers = gift givers)
- YouTube (hobby interests)
- Amazon wishlist (if possible)

**Future Considerations:**
- Reddit (niche interests)
- Letterboxd (movies)
- Steam (gaming)

## Retailer Strategy

**Priority Order:**
1. Independent makers (Etsy, local artisans) - IF accessible/reliable
2. Specialty retailers (UncommonGoods, etc.)
3. Brand direct sites
4. Amazon (as fallback or if perfect match)

**Avoid:**
- Overseas sellers with 6-month shipping
- Unreliable micromerchants
- Hard-to-deal-with sellers

**Goal:** Feel like we "scoured the earth" but practical and accessible.

## UX Principles

- Avoid user paralysis
- Clear platform selection
- Progressive disclosure
- Don't overwhelm with options

## Revenue Model

**Current:** Hybrid
- Free: 1 profile, 5 recs
- Pro Monthly: $4.99
- Pro Annual: $39.99
- Gift Emergency: $2.99 one-time

**Affiliate Reality:** $1-2/user/month (not $4-8)

**Focus:** Core product first, retention features later
